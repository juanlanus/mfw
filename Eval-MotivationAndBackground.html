<h3>MF wireframe prototype</h3>

<p>This document expresses the motivation behind many of the design decision
made, and provides some usability background when it's pertinent. </p>

<p>The work was focused on the task of <em>giving evaluations or feedback</em>.
</p>

<p>This was done so because this interaction context is expected to be the most
used, in terms of man-hours, and as such it deserves the most elaborate and
tested UI. </p>

<h4>The evaluees list</h4>

<p><img alt="evaluees listing" src="imag/evaluees-01.png" width="445"
height="297"></p>

<p>It is structured as a succession of named employee sets, in this case the
first one is "G2G / StarMeUp", the name of a team. </p>

<p>Notice that it's not labeled "team name: G2G / StarMeUp" because those who
are involved <em>already know</em> that this is their team name so the label
would be not only superfluous but almost insulting. </p>

<p>It doesn't need to be a team, it should be possible to summon employees with
any criteria, like for example an SQL query. The criteria should be as elastic
as the variability expected on the field. </p>

<p>Sometimes it will be teams, but it might also be "managers above a certain
level" or "those who work in a location"...</p>

<p>The list is lean, lacking any unnecessary elements like frames or
backgrounds. Although this is not to be considered design but wireframe,
eventually the designers that will style this application should be instructed
to keep it minimalistic. </p>

<p>This is desired in order to reduce <em>cognitive load</em>. A user exposed
to an interaction context (like a screen) has to grok it at a glance, mentally
processing its geometric structure. The more elements the UI has, the higher
the effort to build a mental map for it. The user is not aware of this, but
higher cognitive loads make her tired sooner that if the UI is leaner. </p>

<p>The evaluees are arranged, thus, in a single and simple column that can be
scanned with a single vertical sight swoop. Names are left-aligned in order to
ease this task. </p>

<p>The names are somehow highlighted, or better, the other ancillary stuff is
subdued, so it doesn't interfere with the names. Ultimately, when the user has
found the name she's looking for, she'll be able to find the evaluee's
properties (displayed in smaller, lighter, typography). </p>

<p>Below the evaluee's name a few properties are shown, as few as possible.
Labels are avoided, like for example before the seniority, because it's
obvious. The labels actually shown are less prominent than the data they name:
the data is important, not the labels. Showing the labels like this paves the
way for the user not needing lo look at them in the future; we humans locate
things by their position not their labels. And after using a UI like this, the
user will not look at the labels any more. On the contrary, if labels and data
were displayed with similar visibility, the user would be forced to read both
in order to be able to parse the parts. </p>

<h5>Click on the evaluees list</h5>

<p>When the mouse pointer hovers an evaluee's data, it becomes the usual
pointing hand. This is enough for the user to realize that in order to do
things with that employee she should click on it. </p>

<p>The click target is generously bit, to ease its capture. </p>

<p>Clicking either the picture or the data, the evaluee's info scrolls until
it's flush with the wiewport top edge, and the eval items interaction context
slides from its bottom. </p>

<p>It is done with a quick animation. Quick to avoid wasting the user time, but
animated she can visually control what was the effect of the click. </p>

<h5>Search the evaluees list</h5>

<p><img alt="search evaluees" src="imag/evaluees-02.png"></p>

<p>There is a search minimalistic box at the top right corner of the screen,
and it stays there - which is possible because it's so slim. </p>

<p>Typing <em>anything</em> there immediately triggers a quick search hiding
all the evaluees that do not contain the typed text. </p>

<p>The search mechanism is nimble. It selects the items that contain all the
words or partial words entered in any order, in any of the users file fields,
after a short delay to allow the typing to finish. </p>

<p>For example entering "joh" selects <strong>Joh</strong>n Travolta, Daniel
<strong>Joh</strong>nson and <strong>Joh</strong>n Smith. Typing "mondongo"
selects John Travolta because he has that word in his file. </p>

<h4>The eval items context</h4>

<p>It contains controls suitable for assigning values to named features. The
controls are grouped by visually distinctive headers (shown in white text on
gray background). </p>

<p>All the evaluation value controls are horizontal bars of equal length. </p>

<p>The eval item name is set on the bar; the value is rendered as a blue
background spanning from the left, proportional to the assigned value. For
example if an evaluee was given a 33% of a quality that is expressed as a
percent, then the left third of the related bar will have blue background. </p>

<p>This arrangement allows for a manager to quickly grasp an employee's level,
by weighting the amount of blue in her evaluations block. </p>

<p><img alt="good" src="imag/evalitems-02.png" width="229" height="109">   
<img alt="bad" src="imag/evalitems-03.png" width="220" height="108"></p>

<p>The images above depict two evaluations, one full of blue corresponding to a
good employee, and the other short of blue for a candidate to be fired soon.
</p>

<p>The design structure allows for this to happen. </p>

<h5>The eval items</h5>

<p>In this example there are different evaluation item controls, reflecting
different criteria for measuring each one. </p>
<pre>1: { id:'1', type:'header', description:'First group of eval items' },
2: { id:'2', type:'number', description:'Positive idiosyncrasy', topValue:'3000' },
3: { id:'3', type:'p100',   description:'Anthropometric synergic attitude' },
4: { id:'4', type:'binary', description:'Is a natural leadership junkie' },
5: { id:'5', type:'header', description:'Second group of eval items' },
6: { id:'6', type:'binary', description:'Has that success tendency' },
7: { id:'7', type:'step',   description:'Advise acceptance', steps:['awful', 'low', 'regular', 'high', 'impressing'] },
8: { id:'8', type:'spacer' }</pre>

<p>The types shown are a number, a percent, a yes/no option, and an enumerated
choice. The definitions are shown above. </p>

<p>This is <em>one evaluation criteria</em>. There might (and will) be more
than one. Like for example a company will likely use different criteria to
evaluate managers, clerks, blue-collar workers, gardeners, salesmen, etc. It's
wishful thinking to ask a company to evaluate <em>all</em> their employees with
a single criteria (unless it's a small company with a very homogeneous staff).
</p>

<p>Anyway, whatever the evaluation criteria, the more the blue, the better the
employee, at a glance. </p>

<h5>Evaluated or not</h5>

<p>Each new evaluation appears loaded with the previous evaluation's values in
the graphic bars, but the value are not displayed in the textual values column
on the right side of the bars, as shown in the image below. This employee is
not yet evaluated. </p>

<p><img alt="not yet evaluated" src="imag/evalitems-04.png" width="426"
height="218"></p>

<p>The user has the previous evaluation as a guideline. She can set the values
using the mouse (clicking on the desired position of the bar) or textually
(clicking on or tabbing to the textual display and entering a value). </p>

<p>After the values are entered, the employee is effectively evaluated and the
values are displayed in the textual values column, as shown below: </p>

<p><img alt="already evaluated" src="imag/evalitems-05.png" width="427"
height="217"></p>

<p>In the evaluees list, those who are already evaluated depict a big checkmark
\u2713 on the right hand side of the data area, or a lighter (\u2705 hollow)
checkmark if the evaluation is not yet complete. </p>

<p><span
style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 400%;">✓ ✅
</span></p>

<p>Also the header items should display complete indicators when all the
required eval items under are already done. This is to save the user the task
of having to scrutinize many detail-level items when trying to find out what's
missing. </p>

<p>Also it should be evident for the user which eval items are optional and
which are not. One simple way would be to change the eval item name typography,
like for example change its color or make it italic. </p>

<h5>The context menu</h5>

<p>Most of the times the user would only want to set evaluation values for
users she already knows, using evaluation criteria she's comfortable with. </p>

<p>But, there will be a few cases, like rookie evaluators or newly added
evaluees, that will deserve more on-screen information. </p>

<p>For these cases there should be contextual menus (not implemented) allowing,
for example, to pop up illustrative windows and more actions. </p>

<p>One typical action here is to cancel an evaluation of an item. This is
sipposed to seldom hapen, so we are better off with a hidden menu option than
by spreading crosses all around the screen. </p>

<h4>Keyboard input</h4>

<p>If the application is really to be used in any company bigger than a
startup, there will be mid-level managers chartered with the routine evaluation
of their crew possibly prolific. </p>

<p>This warrants the implementation of a really sound keyboard input feature,
in order to allow them to sort through this task swiftly. It doesn't matter if
they can't grasp the kb operation initially, they will want to do later (keep
in mind that many of these managers were clerks until recently). </p>

<p>Clumsyness of the UI is a lofty rejection factor for an application, and the
LB input feature is an important nimbleness factor for many, if well done. </p>

<h3>Architecture suggestions</h3>

<p>We developers have a heavy tendence towards <em>self-referential design</em>
(SRd). </p>

<p>It's a deviant design schema that can be expressed in brief thus: "If it's
good for me then it's good, period". </p>

<p>This contradicts with the "The customer is always right" principle in that,
under SRd, the customer will happen to be <em>wrong</em> most of the times. </p>

<p>Actually, we will be thinking our way while the customer tries to explain us
their needs and cravings. </p>

<p>A good stance, based on my experience (about 30 years selling ready-made
software to big companies), is <em>to expect anything</em>. </p>

<p>It is not surprising that many of the most successful software constructs
are designed with that openness of mind. Think Eclipse, Visual Basic and Visual
Studio, facebook, vim, Apache, firefox, Linux, you-name-it. </p>

<p>It's not a matter of size, but the ability to allow the user to configure
and add plugins at will, until the thing works as expected, fulfilling the
user's particular and unique requirements without needing to twist their arms,
at all. </p>

<h4>Objects</h4>

<p>There are a few undeniable and inmutable facts. We need to identify them.
These facts can be reduced to a list of objects. There will be ...</p>
<ul>
  <li>users (people) with a variety of properties like cost center or area or
    project, and seniority or category or grade or whatever, each client using
    their owm schemata</li>
  <li>evaluee sets, generically made out of a query selecting a team, an area,
    a project, a country, a branch, a gender, an age span, or whatever </li>
  <li>evaluators, defined as users wuth a scope made out of one or more evaluee
    sets</li>
  <li>evaluations, made up of evaluation criteria (not necessarily a single
    one) and not necessarily organized in a hypercubic hierarchy</li>
  <li>an evaluation criteria will be made up of a set of criterion iitems</li>
  <li>eval items will have different forms, like numbers, percents, yes/no's,
    free text, enumerated, and more that are to come</li>
  <li>eventually cycles or periods for clients that want to enforce a rythm, or
    the lack of them but maybe a frequency requirement not tied to
  timeframes</li>
</ul>

<p>The general idea is to be as generic as possible, and to become specific by
means of sensible defaults and smart customization. Defaults shold be good for
smaller companies. </p>

<p>Any worthwhile company will be glad to shell a check for our work on setting
up the application, and this would also be useful to us for the purpose of
learning more about the generalized client needs, also known as software
requirements. In my experience, it was never possible to anticipate all the
client requirements up front. </p>

<h4>Modularity</h4>

<p>The software must be modular, allowing for the upcoming developer
generations to keep pluging in new modulii at specific points. </p>

<p>Like for example to make easy to store, handle and display a (not
predefined) variety of evaluee properties, or new eval item types. </p>

<p>Also, the system must have the ability to plug into the client's services in
order to get data - maybe not storing it in our application, or send email to
the employees. This would enable access to big companies, the worthwhile kind
of client. </p>
