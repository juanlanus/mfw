<ul>
  <li>We should define an API and publish it, for the clients to be able to
    integrate this application with theirs. 
    <p>Then, we should model all our services after that API, instead of having
    a number of tiny interactions. </p>
    <p>The consolidation of the backend actions in a lean small number of basic
    actions would hide the actual design of the database schema, allowing us to
    evolve it as needed. </p>
  </li>
  <li>In the topics table we need a text instructions field, to be shown to the
    user, like "enter from 2 to 4 goals in this axis". 
    <p>This is needed bacause else the user wouldn't know why the "commit"
    button is not enabled (like, if she chose 5 goals). </p>
  </li>
  <li>No traceability: some tables loaded by the user's interactions lack a
    timestamp. </li>
  <li>No change management: the topics table lacks an end date (and perhaps a
    start date). </li>
  <li>The <code>tm_translations</code> table should include the organization
    id in its clave, in order to cater for the different names each company
    culture assigns to the application objects like "topics" and "competences".
    Alternatively, something similar could be achieved through configuration,
    like ODBC does. Fo example in BS the word for "topic" is "eje". </li>
  <li>The table <code>tm_countries</code> should have a column holding the
    default language, for global organizations that have employees in different
    locations. Same for <code>tm_organization_offices</code>. </li>
  <li>Fields like <code>name</code> in <code>tm_organization_offices</code>
    should be translatable. </li>
  <li>The generalized idea is that the user sets a quantitative goal and then
    she starts to grow a number attempting to reach her goal. But, in some
    cases it might happen that she starts with a value and tries to
    <em>reduce</em> it, for example in cases like errors or risks. 
    <p>Will the client ask us for diminishing goals? </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>BS</h2>
<ul>
  <li>According to <a
    href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aIpU_L0LTg7UY7XI6B_HibGOeAKzekRnP62_mi20Q9o/edit">the
    Supervielle Smart evals doc</a>, the weight of each goal is set by the
    user. 
    <p>On the other hand, the database schema seems to define the ponderation
    factor as a property of a competence, n a creepy way. </p>
    <p>Which one is right?</p>
    <pre>CREATE TABLE smarteval_competencies (
id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
enabled INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, 
topicId BIGINT NOT NULL,
    orderNumber INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, 
    type VARCHAR(30),
CONSTRAINT fkCompetencyTopic FOREIGN KEY (topicId) REFERENCES smarteval_topics (id)
);

CREATE TABLE smarteval_competencies_weighted (
id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
weight FLOAT NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT fkCompetencyWeightedCompetency FOREIGN KEY (id) REFERENCES smarteval_competencies (id)
)

Note: I see a design issue here, as the PK of the related table is an autonumber too, while it should be set as a copy of the target table's PK. 
It might happen that a competency is created without its eaight: the PKs would be out of sync from now on. </pre>
  </li>
</ul>
