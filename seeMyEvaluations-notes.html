    <p>Disregard, it's only a placeholder. The logo, the colors, and the menu,
    will be defined in other document. </p>
    <p>Especially, the wording of the menu items is wrong. </p>
    <p>Moreover, the branding should be easily replaceable by the client's. </p>

  </li>
  <li><span class="n-UI-ref">All October 2015 evaluations</span> 
    <p>Clicking the dropdown icon to the right opens the filters popup (try
    it). </p>
    <p>This title is built in the processing of the filters. </p>
    <p>The word "All" is because of the "source" choice. The other sources
    translate into "My managers", "My team" and "My employees". </p>
    <p>The "October 2015" part is so bacause the user chose the full month, so
    we avoid showing "from 01-10-2015 until 31-10-2015", instead the single
    word "October" makes it much easier to read. </p>
    <p>Notice that "October 2015" is highlighted (as a few other labels below).
    This allows the user to scan the page very quickly, as those elements stop
    their eyes during the scan. Notice how the personal data, in the left-hand
    column, does not stand out and thus it does not interfere with the reading
    of the relevant parts. </p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="n-UI-ref">The "Select query period and sources" popup</span>
    <p>The "since" and "until" sections are built to make it easier to choose
    the most likely periods: the previous month or the current one. </p>
    <p>The selected options should reflect that likeliness, like for example id
    it's October 2nd. then offer the previous month. </p>
    <p>The third options render the usual calendars bound to keyboard input
    fields more suitable for people that are keyboard-friendly (the calendars
    are for chubby women attempring to purchase cat chow online). </p>
    <p>The "Source" part is pretty obvious. The default is "All", the most
    likely one. </p>
    <p>When the page opens, it is already displaying the evaluations selected
    by the default options, to save the user the burden of requesting them
    explicitly, each time. </p>
    <p>The Esc key must be binded to the [cancel] buttin, and the Enter key to
    yhe [go] button. </p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="n-UI-ref">"By Any Todd - manager" and "By G2G MyFeedback
    team - peers"</span>
    <p>This are, obviously, the who evaluated this guy. The team label is so
    because in the future this UI might need to handle multiple teams, cleanly.
    </p>
    <p>The "G2G MyFeedback" part is the division of the company (G2G) and the
    project this guy is in. </p>
    <p>The team evaluation has no date. The date in the manager evaluation
    might not be available in the model, don't worry. </p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="n-UI-ref">"Interpersonal skills" ...</span>
    <p>This is a topic with its competences. </p>
    <p>The chart part in this wireframe is made up of characters, not very
    suitable for values like the 3.2 that is below. Also the green should be
    replaced bt gray. </p>
    <p>The text to the right is the optional comment. </p>
    <p>The evaluation values have a textual value too. It is displayed when the
    mouse pointer hovers the graph (the green squares). </p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="n-UI-ref">Responsive</span>
    <p>Notice that when the viewport is narrowed the elements <em>move
    under</em> (not ehe header's). . </p>
    <p>Else, this layout leverages the width of the desktop screens to display
    as much evaluation data as possible in a single screen. </p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="n-UI-ref">Where to go from here</span>
    <p>It is not shown, i have no idea yet. </p>
    <p></p>
  </li>
